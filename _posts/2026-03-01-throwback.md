## Dwelling on the past
Well, here it is: Mario Karty. I made a few different versions of it so feel free to pick and choose. Looking at it now, 5+ years later, it's clear that things could still be improved. There may be typos or strange wording, especially in the rules, but I'm still happy with it. It could probably use an update to be more compatible with Mario Kart World, but that's for a later day. There are three versions here: v9, Simple, and Simple Diceless. In general, I'd say get v9.
