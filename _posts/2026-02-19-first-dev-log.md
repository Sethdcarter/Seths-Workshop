## A New Take On The Past
So about 10 years ago, I was working my office job and had a random thought: is there a way to breath some new life into how mario kart is played? 
From there, I made a simple companion game called Mario Karty, where you still play Mario Kart, but you have cards outside the game that give you a challenge for each race: Hit 3 enemies with green shells, finish in 1st place, finish the race with 10 coins, etc. Each card you complete is worth points, and whoever has the most points at the end of the series, wins the game (no more racing for a 1st place overall!). It's a silly fun game, but there was one issue: how do you prove you completed the card? It was reliant on the honor system. 

Here I am today, living in a completely different place, working a completely different job, and another idea strikes out of nowhere: What if bluffing was the central mechanic to it?

#### Thus, Mario Kart Scoundrel was born. 

I've only worked on it for a couple of days but here is the jist: You get a challenge before each race. It is hidden so no other players know what you have. You play the race in Mario Kart, and afterward, everyone shares what their card was and whether it was completed. But this is a bluffing game. I don't have to tell the truth. No one does. After everyone has shared what their card was and whether they completed it (maybe saying something like "Yeah, I had hit 5 enemies with green shells. Did that, in fact, I hit 6!), all the players secretly vote to review the replay for one of the players. If it is a tie, no replay is viewed and everyone gets their points (whether it was true or not), but if there is a majority pick, that player gets reviewed. Watch the replay for them only and see if they were telling the truth. If they lied, all the players who voted for the review of them will get some bonus points, but if they were telling the truth, they will get the bonus points. Repeat the process for all 4 races and whoever has the most points at the end of the series wins the game.

It's still a work in progress but I'm happy with how it's coming along. It will need some numbers tuning and I still need to design the cards and brainstorm some potential additional wrenches to throw in there for fun. 

At some point, I'll try to dig up the old Mario Karty files and share those as well.

That's all for today, thanks for reading.
